## Description

"So son... what do you want to do in life?"

Your uncle stares at you blankly across the dinner table. You stare back dumbly, glancing in every other direction in 0.5 seconds intervals.

"Uh.... maybe a programmer? I don't really know to be honest."

The family sits in silence for a few seconds...

BZZZ...BZZZZ...

Saved by the buzzer

"Sorry I gotta get this..."

You walk from the dinner table and into your room to pick up the phone.

"Dude you took your time to pick up..."

"Yeah was at a family reunion"

"Got anything else on him? I heard him talking about something he found while at university that was super top secret or something... I want to know what it is"
