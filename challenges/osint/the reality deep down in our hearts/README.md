# The Reality Deep Down in our Hearts

Category: OSINT
Difficulty: Easy

## Challenge Description

BANG. You smack your table in frustration.

"YOU'RE ACTUALLY SO TRASH AT THIS GAME!"

You quickly shutdown your computer and jump into bed.

"Sigh. Maybe I shouldn't have shouted."

You pick up your phone and go on to the bad boys website. Scrolling through the posts you think to yourself.

"Do these people ever feel bad when they do these things?"
