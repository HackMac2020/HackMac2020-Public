`Staff` in the game uses 1 byte to store `health` value so, the value can be from -128 to 127. The idea is to overflow `health` value of either opponent to win the game. 
However, the first oponent `Lesley Legend` has too low `health` and too high `damage`, there is no way you can defeat him so just choose whatever `Student` to "lose" against him. 
One you are defeated by `Lesley Legend`, choose `F- Student` to fight against `Brucy Boi` and then use the combo 3-3-2 (Submit a Complaint to HR for 2 times and Hit the UBAR) for 4 times. By then, `health` of `Brucy Boi` will be overflowed and turned back to -128 hence, defeated.
When you gain this winning condition, the game will allow you to input your name in the scoreboard and then the game will try to execute a function to print the opponent's information. Observe the assembly code of the game and you will see that the game frees `Staff` object once you defeated them and later on allocate a block of memory with the same size of `Staff` for scoreboard. Because of this, it creates a use-after-free exploit where the newly allocated block will take the address of the previously freed memory block. 
Exploit this by inputing the memory address of the system call function in `SecretLevel`. Now the address of the system call function is stored in address of the previously freed `Staff` and upon executing the function to print the opponent's information, the game will execute the system call function and give a shell.
