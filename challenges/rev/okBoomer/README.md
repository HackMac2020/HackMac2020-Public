# DR EVIL IS BACK AGAIN WITH AN EVEN MORE MENACING BOMB!
Difficulty: Who Dares Wins

This Binary bomb contains several stages requiring different inputs from either the console or in a text file. The goal is to analyse and understand the assembly language and steps the bomb takes as it executes the program. Through this understanding, the hacker is expected to manipulate their inputs in a manner that provides them a flag and prevents the bomb from detonating. Each bomb detonation will be noted and points will be deducted accordinly. 

Desc: Dr Evil is back again with an even more menacing bomb which is way harder to defuse than most you would have seen on the internet.
This one requires you to think outside of the box in most cases, however, most stages will rely and implement well known techniques to solve these stages.
Fortunately for you, although the bomb explodes you will not be losing any points.
However try and take it as a life or death situation and defuse the bomb without exploding it more than 5 times!

Good luck and God Speed.
